# Domain Modeling

* "The process of creating conceptual model in code for a specific problem"

1. The model describes:
    
    * various entities
    * attributes/behaviors
    * constraints that govern the problem domain

    * A well articulated domain model can help as a communication tool between the business and technical teams.

1. Define a constructor and initialize properties

    * constructor functions are used to define teh same properties between many objects.

1. Generate Random Numbers

    * use the Math.random() function

* The rest of the reading was mainly follow along code that I performed in the console. This helped me to kind of wrap my head around domain modeling.

# Chapter 6 - Tables

1. Stretching out columns (colspan) and rows (rowspan)

    * stretch out columns using 'colspan'

# JavaScript Chapter 3 - Functions, Methods, Objects

1. Creating an Object

    * 'new' keyword and object constructor create a blank object.

1. Keyword 'this'

    * commonly used inside functions and objects. 

1. Arrays are objects

    * special type of object that hold a related set of key/value pairs
    * can be combined to create complex data structures

1. Built in objects

    1. Browser object model
    1. Document object model (DOM)
