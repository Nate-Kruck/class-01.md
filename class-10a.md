## Key Concepts in Positioning Elements

    Block-Level and Inline-Level

    Block-level elements start on a new line (h1, p, ul, li are all examples of block level elements)
    Inline-level elements flow between surrounding text (img, b, i are all examples of inline level elements)

1. Different positioning schemes

    Normal flow - position:static  
    Relative - position:relative  
    Absolute - position:absolute  
    Fixed - position:fixed  
    Floating - float - take property in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible  
    Clear property allows you to say that no element within the same containing element should touch the left or right hand sides of a box.  
    OverLapping Elements - z-index

    *** box offset will tell the browser where the box should be positioned
